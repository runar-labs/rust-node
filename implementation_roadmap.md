Implementation Progress and Roadmap

## Completed Changes

- Updated NodeConfig to align with the new architecture (multiple network IDs, required node_id)
- Started implementing new NetworkTransport trait with methods for remote action handlers
- Created BaseNetworkTransport struct to encapsulate common network fields
- Updated ServiceRegistry to separate local and remote handlers

## Current Issues

- Linter errors in Node implementation due to:
  - Mismatches between ServiceRegistry method signatures and their usage
  - References to old NetworkTransport methods
  - ServiceResponse field access issues
  - TopicPath creation and usage issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of NetworkTransport trait in QuicTransport
2. Update ServiceRegistry implementation to fully separate local and remote handlers
3. Fix remaining issues in Node implementation to work with the updated interfaces
4. Implement RemoteService lifecycle management with create_from_capabilities
5. Implement load balancing for remote handlers

## Implementation Strategy

A systematic approach to remaining changes:

1. First complete the ServiceRegistry implementation
2. Then update the NetworkTransport implementations
3. Finally update Node to use both correctly

This will allow us to resolve the circular dependencies cleanly.
