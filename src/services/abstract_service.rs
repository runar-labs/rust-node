// Abstract Service Definition Module
//!
//! This module defines the core AbstractService trait that all services must implement,
//! along with its associated types and enumerations. It establishes the foundation
//! for service implementation, lifecycle management, and communication patterns.
//!
//! # Architectural Principles
//! 1. Interface-First Design - All services must implement a consistent interface
//! 2. Lifecycle Management - Services follow a predictable lifecycle (init, start, stop)
//! 3. Consistent Communication - All services use the same request/response patterns
//! 4. Self-Describing Services - Services provide metadata about their capabilities
//! 5. Asynchronous Operations - All service methods are async for performance
